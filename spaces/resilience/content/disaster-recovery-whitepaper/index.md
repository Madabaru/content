title: "Disaster Recovery of Workloads on AWS: Recovery in the Cloud Whitepaper"
description: "Disaster recovery is the process of preparing for and recovering from a disaster. An event that prevents a workload or system from fulfilling its business objectives in its primary deployed location is considered a disaster. This paper outlines the best practices for planning and testing disaster recovery for any workload deployed to AWS, and offers different approaches to mitigate risks and meet the Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO) for that workload."
