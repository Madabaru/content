## Introduction

Deploying infrastructure to AWS manually can be time-consuming and prone to errors. In this post, we'll go over how to set up a CI/CD pipeline for automated AWS deployments using GitLab and Terraform.

We'll configure the necessary permissions in AWS IAM to allow GitLab to create infrastructure. We'll create an S3 bucket and DynamoDB table to store remote Terraform state or use GitLab's built-in state management.

Next, we'll write a Terraform script to deploy AWS resources and a matching .gitlab-ci.yml file to execute the script on commit. Finally, we'll test the pipeline by deploying sample infrastructure.

By following this guide, you'll learn infrastructure-as-code best practices for GitLab and Terraform and have an automated deployment pipeline to AWS ready for your infrastructure repos. Let's get started on setting up smooth AWS deployments with GitLab and Terraform.

Outline:

* Authorizing a new identity provider (with OpenID Connect) in IAM.
* Creating a role with a trust policy allowing GitLab to create the AWS resources.
* Creating an S3 Bucket and DynamoDB Table to allow Terraform to manage state.
* Alternative: Using GitLab-managed Terraform state.
* Providing the role to GitLab CI to allow the retrieval of temporary credentials.
* Writing a terraform script that uses the S3 Bucket and DynamoDB table as a backend.
* Writing the corresponding .gitlab-ci.yml file to execute the script in a GitLab Runner.
* Deploying a sample Terraform script. 

Conclusion:

And that's it! We've set up an automated AWS deployment pipeline using GitLab and Terraform best practices. Now anytime you push changes to your infrastructure code, GitLab CI will trigger Terraform to deploy those changes to AWS.

In this post we covered configuring IAM permissions and roles for GitLab, creating S3 and DynamoDB resources to store remote state, writing a Terraform script to deploy infrastructure, setting up a .gitlab-ci.yml pipeline to execute on commits, and testing our automated deployments.

By following these steps, you can take the manual work and errors out of deploying to AWS. Your infrastructure becomes code that can be treated like any other application code.

As you expand your infrastructure, be sure to continue using security best practices like least privilege IAM roles. And leverage GitLab's power with features like the Terraform template library.

Now whenever inspiration strikes, you can implement and deploy new AWS infrastructure automatically in a fraction of the time. You're ready to use GitLab and Terraform to streamline your cloud deployments!
